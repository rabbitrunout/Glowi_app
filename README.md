## ✨ Introduction  

**Glowi** is an intuitive web platform that connects parents and the rhythmic gymnastics school in one unified system.  
It provides parents with quick and easy access to:
- their child’s training schedule,  
- competition calendar,  
- payment history,  
- and a showcase of achievements (medals, diplomas, and progress).

The app was designed to reflect the **grace and glow** of gymnastics — using a **neon color palette**, **soft gradients**, and **responsive animations**.
